# rj32 llemu

This is a low level emulator for rj32.

This emulator is not designed to be fast, but rather to be closer to the hardware implementation. This is in order to develop microcode and an idea of how the timing will work and other low level details.

`emurj` is designed to be as fast as possible on a modern cpu and so does not implement many of these details.
